# S&P-500 Index price prediction.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the application of various machine learning models and time series forecasting techniques to predict the S&P 500 index price. Through extensive data collection and analysis, it became evident that the Big 5 tech stocks have a strong influence on the overall index, as indicated by their high correlation. The S&P-500 has shown a long-term trend of positive returns, with notable fluctuations during major economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite experimenting with multiple Machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, the results revealed limitations in their predictive capabilities, especially in capturing the complex patterns of financial time series data. However, the Facebook Prophet model stood out by delivering reliable forecasts, suggesting an upward trend in the index over the next two to three years. This project highlights the importance of model selection, feature engineering, and domain knowledge in financial forecasting, and sets a foundation for more advanced modeling and optimization in the future.
